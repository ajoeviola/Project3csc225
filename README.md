# Project3 Csc225

This project is a simple video game console site. It fetches console information from an API collection of consoles at http://csc225.mockable.io/consoles
The site will load a loading notification until the request to the API collection responds back, which will then hide the loading notifcation and output the list of consoles. 

## Installation
The folder should be opened in any text editor that supports HTML/CSS/Javascript, such as Visual Studio code, Atom, etc. From there you can start a live server of the website.
